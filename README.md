# Playful Keyboard ðŸŽ¹ðŸŽµ
This project is a playful exploration of combining keyboard inputs with musical sounds. It provides a simple interface where each key corresponds to a different musical note. Users can either click on the graphical buttons or press the corresponding keys on their keyboards to produce sounds reminiscent of a keyboard instrument.

## Features:
Interactive Interface: The interface features a set of buttons representing keys on a keyboard. Each button has a distinct graphical representation and corresponds to a specific musical note.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts dynamically to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
Keyboard Input: Users can trigger sounds either by clicking on the graphical buttons or by pressing the corresponding keys on their physical keyboards.
Customizable Melodies: By combining different keys, users can create their melodies, fostering creativity and experimentation.
Auditory Feedback: Upon pressing a key, the application generates the corresponding sound, providing immediate auditory feedback.
Sound Variation: Each key produces a unique sound, adding variety and richness to the musical experience.
Informational Footer: A footer provides users with a prompt encouraging them to create their melodies, enhancing engagement and interactivity.

## Technologies Used:
HTML: Structured the content and layout of the application.
CSS: Styled the interface to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly design.
JavaScript: Implemented the functionality for generating sounds both on mouse click and keyboard press events.

## Note:
This project serves as a demonstration of programming proficiency and is intended for recreational use. The keyboard sounds are designed for entertainment purposes and do not replace professional music software or instruments. Enjoy creating your melodies and have fun exploring the playful world of keyboard music! ðŸŽ¼ðŸŽ¹
